It’s all the same thing to live a life, everyone comes empty-handed,
they live as they spread the story like novels all around the world.
Don’t be disappointed by yourself, you cannot be good on everything.
It just has to be a better tomorrow than today, the life is right now!
Amor fati, amor fati!

It would be a lie to say you never thought and wandered around,
holding the brush called life, about what you are to draw.
Why talk about it? The love passed by like an arrow shot,
but those memories were glorious yet sad happiness.
The age is nothing but numbers; it’s the mind that matters. Just go where your heart takes you!
Say good-bye to the sadness from now on. Oh, life, I will visit you only once!
You’re required to date, and it’s a choice to marry. Just go where your heart takes you!
The tears are nothing but the bubbles of the farewell.
Amor fati, amor fati!
